# Ahm
Ahm (ah-m) is a Discord Bot for my Destiny 2 clan that primarily gives roles. 

Originally I only planned for Ahm to be used personally, but releasing something sounds neat so that'll be my first priority after testing.

## User Commands
### [TitleAdd](https://github.com/TuneFlat/Ahm.DiscordBot/blob/main/Modules/RoleModules/TitleRoleModule.cs) `title name`
Checks to see if the user has obtained the title in Destiny. If the user has the title then the role matching the title will be given.
### [TitleRemove](https://github.com/TuneFlat/Ahm.DiscordBot/blob/main/Modules/RoleModules/TitleRoleModule.cs)  `title name`
Removes the title role

## Admin Commands
### [clear](https://github.com/TuneFlat/Ahm.DiscordBot/blob/main/Modules/UtilityModules/ClearModule.cs)  `amount` 
Deletes the amount of specified messages. If no value is given, the last 100 messages will be deleted.
